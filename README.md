## Tech Used

### for Phase 1
 - React 
	 - React Router
	 -  React BootStrap and Materal UI for layout
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - EmailJS for form

### for Phase 2 (in progress)
Currently, I'm thinking...
 - remove React Bootstrap and only use Material UI for performance
 - Headless CMS, for content
 - Progressive Web App
 - new test subdomain for edwardma.ca, as github pages doesn't support SPA
